	=== Released 0.7.1 ===

	* src/infconfig.c: default frame rate dropped to 15 fps. Default
	screen size bumped to 512x288
	* src/renderer.c: re-enabled all keyboard shortcuts to control
	playing and take snapshots. Shortcuts to control volume	not
	re-enabled yet (for some reason a quick sequence of UP or DOWN's
	freezes Audacious). Re-enabled support of title displaying.
	* configure.ac: added dependency for glib-dbus-1 library.

2011-11-23  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: automake version required bumped to 1.9
	* po/LINGUAS: added. New versions of gettext require it

2011-11-21  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: cleaned up and updated. Vectorization enabled by
	default (gcc 4 is old enough now). Glib version required bumped to
	2.8 (for g_mkdir_with_parents())
	* autogen.sh: added again to the repository, for ease of
	development
	* Makefile.in: removed from the repo. I don't know why was there
	* src/config-dialog.c: translation catalogs bind to the right
	package name. Updated creation of GtkSpinButton to avoid use of
	deprecated API. Config window properly configured to be shown on
	top of the rest of the Audacious windows.

2009-04-18  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	will take care of generate one.
	* src/config-dialog.c:
	* src/infconfig.c:

2005-04-12  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/compute.c: Too many cleanups, thanks to the 'splint' tool.
	Added compute_quit(). This fix a SERIOUS memory leak.
	* src/display.c: pcm_data_mutex was released too early!!!!
	Thanks Valgrind.

2005-04-12  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: now MMX detection is disabled on non Intel 32
	bit architectures (I'm not sure if the checks works for AMD64).
	* src/cputest.c: don't use inline mmx assembly instructions
	if the target isn't an Intel 32 bit machine and mmx detection
	was not requested. Fix bugs #1105207 and #1106762.

2004-11-12  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.6.0 === 

	* src/infconfig.c: config window fully functional.

2004-11-06  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.c: about window now is created using
	xmms_show_message().
	* src/renderer.c: usleep() -> xmms_usleep().
	* src/compute.c: finally fixed bug #1059004 !
	- mmx_t variables qualified volatile.
	- punpcklbw_m2r changed to punpcklbw_r2r (dohh).
	* configure.ac:
	- version bumped to 0.6.0.
	- usleep() check removed.
	- mmx detection enabled by default!
	

2004-11-04  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: now we test for gtk+ to be at least 1.2.2.

2004-11-03  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/cputest.c: really define things when MMX_DETECTION
	is set (problem arises because of the move of MMX_DETECTION
	to config.h file).
	* src/compute.c: made mmx section smaller (but still not
	working :-(.
	
2004-11-02  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/renderer.c, src/infconfig.c: more work on config
	window, specially on FPS setting.

2004-11-01  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/renderer.c: now we cleanly quit plugin on SDL_QUIT
	event.
	* infinity-plugin.glade: added.
	* src/config-dialog.*: added. New config window builded with
	Glade.

2004-10-31  John Lightsey <john@nixnuts.net>

	* src/*: most integral types moved to Glib bit-fixed 
	types, for portability. infinite_states managed to work
	on big-endian machines.

2004-09-28  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/gettext.h: we include locale.h if it is available.
	I hope this fix bug #1015706.
	
2004-09-21  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.9 === 

	* configure.ac: now we use AC_CONFIG_HEADER(config.h).
	* src/display.c: key repeat enabled.
	* src/renderer.c: allowed xmms control through the 
	standard keys (thanks YoaR suggestion). Faster event
	check.
	* src/main.c: a command keys summary are showed on 
	startup. Check if we have setlocale() before to try
	to enable NLS (thanks bug report from ibpalle@hotmail.com).
	* src/config.*: renamed to src/infconfig.*.

2004-06-25  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/display.c: removed atexit(SDL_Quit), because
	is dangerous on a dynamic library according to SDL
	docs.
	
2004-06-24  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/renderer.c: don't init/set_pcm/quit while we
	are initializing. Final objective is to remove the
	bug that makes XMMS crash when we quickly
	enable/disable the plugin (thanks to Cristian Rosa).

2004-06-22  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.8 === 
	
	* PLANS: added.
	* README.non-i386: removed.
	* src/config.c: if detect old version config file,
	update it.

	Why? read comment there.

2004-06-21  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/Makefile.am: changed -O2 to -O3 flag.
	* src/config.*: t_config made private. Added
	functionality to manage window position/size.
	* src/main: on exit, we save window position/size.
	
2004-06-19  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/renderer.c: broken resizing when MMX disabled
	was fixed

2004-06-20  Jean Delvare  <khali@linux-fr.org>

	* src/main.c: version info is added to plugin
	description
	* src/display.c: on minimize, correct title is showed

2004-06-19  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.7 === 
	
	* configure.ac: sets the prefix to the prefix of
	the working xmms found.
	MMX support is now disabled by default.
	
2004-06-07  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* building files rebuilded with Autoconf 2.59 and
	Automake 1.85

2004-05-21  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: before try to run macros AM_PATH_XMMS
	and AM_PATH_SDL, check if xmms-config and sdl-config
	exists, and show an understandable error. Thanks to
	Cristian Rosa.

2004-05-19  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: AC_INIT now uses the complete form, 
	the tarball name is now infinity-plugin.
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE modernized to the no-arguments
	form, AC_OUTPUT modernized to the no-arguments form.
	Added checking for some headers and const compiler
	characteristic.
	
2004-05-18  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.6 === 
	
	* configure.ac: Fixed pkg-config macro to look for
	gtk+ package, not gtk. Thanks to Dennis Smith and
	Andrew Montgomery.

	* src/renderer.c: 
	- check_events() changed to poll events until the
	event queue is empty.
	- usleep() used instead of SDL_Delay().
	
2004-05-17  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.5 ===

	* REPORT-BUGS: added

2004-05-15  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac:
	- Finally I move the gtk and glib flags to be 
	detected via pkg-config. This fix a building 
	problem on Debian. Thanks to Cristian Rosa.
	- Show a warning if the arquitecture is bigendian,
	because Infinity have no been reported to work on this.
	- Check for long long type support.
	- Check for inline support.

	* src/display.c: compute_surface() moved to compute
	module. Now display_quit() destroy the SDL_mutex
	created with display_init()

	* src/types.h: added
	
2004-05-14  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.4 ===

	* src/renderer.c: Come back to SDL_mutex, because
	of reports about completely deadlock on some systems.
	Also use SDL_GetTicks() and SDL_Delay() to limit the 
	framerate.
	Accordingly to SDL docs, calling library functions
	from within an SDL_thread is unsafe.

2004-05-13  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.3 === 

	* src/renderer.c: Added mechanism to send go to
	sleep the renderer while the window is iconified.
	
2004-05-12  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/renderer.c: Added an SDL event filter to 
	ignore the VIDEORESIZE event while resizing
	internal structures. Much better than disable
	the VIDEORESIZE event with SetEventState

2004-05-11  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/renderer.c:
	 - Added a mechanism to limit
	the frames per second rendered. This gives an 
	incredible performance boost on small windows.
	 - Moved finished_mutex to a GStaticMutex, which 
	works inside the renderer body, unlike SDL_mutex
	(I dunno why, may be because of the special
	treat of signals on SDL).
	 - Now the entire body of the render is a CS.
	 - Too much code clean up on check_events()
	 - Now interactive mode is enabled via 
	'--enable-debug' configure option.
		
	* src/display.c:
	- SDL mutex moved to GStaticMutex
	- added atexit(SDL_Quit) call
	- too much error control on SDL calls
	
	* src/*.c all: strings sended to console, turned
	non-translatable. In future, only strings showed
	on windows will be translated.

2004-05-10  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.2 === 
	
	* src/compute.c: Added new type vector_field_t.
	This type have the width and height of the field.
	The final objective is to remove dependencies on
	global screen dimension parameters.

	* src/display.c: many functions modified to make
	use of screen parameters via arguments. Added
	display_set_pcm_data(), wich is thread safe.

	* src/renderer.c: set SDL to ignore events not
	relevant to Infinity.
	
2004-05-09  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/*.c: changed to show output via g_log using
	g_message. Glib's docs says that a library must
	use g_log, not g_print.
	
2004-05-08  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac: Added argument to enable/disable
	compilation of MMX stuff

	* src/renderer.c: some code conditionally compiled
	depending on MMX_DETECTION macro definition

	* README.non-i386: Added

2004-05-08  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.1 === 
	
	* src/renderer.c: now the SDL_VIDEORESIZE is disabled
	while updating the internal structures, so the
	user can't resize until Infinity has been effectively
	resized. This avoid unnecessary resize calculations.

	* src/display.c now display_surface() locks the screen
	before accesing the pixels, if the surface is on video
	memory.
	
2004-05-07  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	=== Released 0.5.0 ===
	
	* src/config.c changed default size to 380x240.
	Added a tooltip to the Scale Factor option,
	and another to the Ok button explaining how to
	switch between fullscreen/window mode.

	* README removed comment about the 8bbp mode. 
	I consider this deprecated. Also updated the
	URL of the project site.
	
2004-05-06  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Feature After all this job, now the plugin could be
	resized!
	
	* src/renderer.c Changed to take into account the 
	screen resize event.

	* src/display.c Added display_screen_resize().
	init_sdl() changed to allocate memory with g_malloc().

	* src/compute.c Added compute_resize(). Changed
	compute_interpol_new() constructor to
	compute_interpol_field_new(width, height).

	* Documentation Doxygen support added.
	The intention is to document the modules interfaces
	ONLY, so I comment the headers (except main.c, that of
	course doesn't a main.h). This way I only document
	that the modules expose, not that is private to them.
	The internals of the modules are docummented trough
	traditional comments.
	
	
2004-05-01  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	*   === Released 0.4.0 === 

	* This release was made it on the new Infinity's
	SourceForge site

2004-04-13  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure.ac added macro to require autoconf >= 2.57 to
	reconfigure	the package

	* src/renderer.c eliminated global variable vector_field

	* src/display.c added private global variable vector_field
	and blur() modified to use it. compute_surface() make it inline.
	Too much code cleanup

	* src/compute.c added constructor and destructor for
	t_interpol datatype
	
2004-04-04  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* src/main.h removed. All his variables moved to static
	variables on renderer.c
	
	* configure.ac AM_PROG_LIBTOOL macro changed for AC_PROG_LIBTOOL.
	Also AC_DISABLE_STATIC macro used, so now we dont build and
	install libinfinite.a.

	* src/Makefile.am created the libtool target, so now we automatically
	update the libtool script if it becomes out-of-date

2004-04-03  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* too much code cleanup. The final objective is to remove
	every extern declaration and every non-static global variable,
	and give a non-cyclic dependency graph between modules

	* src/Makefile.am added options
	AM_CFLAGS = -Wall -Wimplicit -Wunused -Wmissing-prototypes
	for to force developer to do things more clear

	* src/config.c added. This is for to get a modular way to
	query options from any module

	* src/file.h added
	
	* src/renderer.c now is checked the SDL_QUIT event, so the rende
	exits when the user close the plugin window


2004-04-02  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README.FreeBSD file added
	
	* HISTORY file added
	
	* New translations (es es_AR) in fact are both the
	same. If some spanish want to maintain the 'es'
	translation, are welcome.

2004-03-31  gettextize  <bug-gnu-gettext@gnu.org>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add m4.
	(ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): New variable.
	(EXTRA_DIST): New variable.
	* configure.ac (AC_OUTPUT): Add po/Makefile.in,

2004-03-27  Duilio Protti  <dprotti@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Sources moved to src subdirectory
	
	* configure.in moved to configure.ac
	
	* building files rebuilded with autoconf 2.57 and automake 1.7
	
	* configure.ac: checking for AC_C_VOLATILE in compiler characteristics
	
	* src/cputest.h added
	
	* src/mmx.h added

	* src/main.c: included cputest.h and inlined assembler for to check
	for MMX instructions presence. This is used on function plug_init for to
	launch renderer_mmx() thread if this instructions are available.
	Added comments (in C style, not C++ style).

	* src/renderer.c: function renderer_mmx() added

	* src/display.c function blur_mmx() added
	
	* src/display.c function compute_surface_mmx() added

	* src/display.c: added SDL_DOUBLEBUF to VIDEO_FLAGS mask and then in 
	function display_surface() the call SDL_UpdateRect(screen, 0, 0, 0, 0)
	changed for	SDL_Flip(screen), which is more efficient if the video board
	supports doublebuffer flipping in hardware, otherwise the call is
	equivalent to SDL_UpdateRect(screen, 0, 0, 0, 0).
	
	* src/display.c: plot1 and plot2 functions redefined as macros

	* src/display.c: added the call SDL_WM_SetCaption ("infinity", NULL) for
	to set the window title to "infinity".

v 0.2: Some optimisations, less bugs, better synchronisation, more options.

v 0.11-2:	Infinity now uses automake/autoconf, its installation should not
			be a problem anymore.

v 0.11: Screenshots, better Makefile.

v 0.1: Original version.
