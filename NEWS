Release: 0.7.1
Date: 2011-11-24

Re-enabled navigation keys and fullscreen mode, configuration through
Preferences dialog, settings saved to disk to keep preferences between
different runs, and many other internal updates to catch up with
software ecosystem of 2011.

Release: 0.7.0beta1
Date: 2009-04-18

A long time has past. XMMS is not available anymore in major
distros. Infinity then moves to the newer Audacious media
player based on the old good XMMS. This beta does not
support navigation keys in interactive mode and also does
not support configuration of plugin parameters.

Release: 0.6.2
Date: 2005-07-18

An option was added to let see the current play title on the
Infinity's title bar. Also there is support now for the new
vectorization features which comes with GCC 4.

Release: 0.6.1
Date: 2005-04-15

This release is bugfix focused, it doesn't include any new feature.
Some modules have been examined in depth using tools like splint and
valgrind, many cleanups have been performed and two serious bugs have
been fixed: a memory leak and a too early released semaphore. This
release also fix bugs #1105207 and #1106762 related to 64 bit
architectures.

Release: 0.6.0
Date: 2004-11-12

Now is possible to change the maximum frames per second through
the configure dialog. Also the plugin can be disabled by just
closing the plugin window, and all the current parameters are
automatically saved. A building problem on Fedora Core 2 have
been fixed, and best of all: finally MMX's related bug #1059004
have been fixed, so now Infinity comes with MMX support enabled
by default.

Release: 0.5.9
Date: 2004-09-21

Now xmms playback can be controlled when focus is on infinity
(even on fullscreen) through the "zxcvb" keys. Also could be 
set the main volume and songs could be forward/reward positioned,
all this with the arrow keys. A major building problem with
Fedora Core 2 was fixed.

Release: 0.5.8
Date: 2004-06-22

Now window size is saved on close. Problem with window
resizing when using MMX extensions was fixed. Correct
title is showed on iconified window, version info is
showed on XMMS configuration window, same config file
can be used safely between versions. A development
mailing list was created.

Release: 0.5.7
Date: 2004-06-19

Major bugfix release. Finally the long-live bug that cause
colors to be displayed completely broken on some systems 
was removed, disabling MMX support by default.

The problem is that XMMS also uses MMX extensions, and 
floating point registers and MMX registers are overlaped
(they are exactly the same). So, if there is a context switch
while infinity is using MMX registers (an before to finish
and call emms() to come back to fp mode), the processor
is yielded to XMMS, and then when the control comes back to
infinity, probably the MMX registers are completely trashed,
if XMMS has performed any fp operation.

Release: 0.5.6
Date: 2004-05-18

Two building problems were fixed. A new mechanism to check
SDL events and go idle was introduced.

Release: 0.5.5
Date: 2004-05-17

Minor bugfix release. Fixes a building problem on
Debian distro (and may be others). Now uses pkg-config
to get the compiler flags. Also fixes a memory leak 
when enable/disable Infinity from XMMS. Also some code
cleanup, a new system to report bugs, and the most 
important: the recently created web page of Infinity.
Take a look at the screenshots there.

Release: 0.5.4
Date: 2004-05-14

Major bugfix release. Fixes problem of completely
deadlock when XMMS go to play on some systems. Also
window closing is now disabled, so only XMMS 
enable/disables the plugin.

Release: 0.5.3
Date: 2004-05-13

Now, when the window is iconified, the plugin just go 
sleep and don't consume cpu time. Also, there is a 
limit on the frames/second that the plugin computes, 
so if the window is small or the system very fast, 
just take the timeslice it needs an yields the 
processor to another process.

Release: 0.5.1
2004-05-10 19:01

Now the configure script includes the option 'disable-mmx'
to turn off the MMX detection support, so the plugin
would be compile on any platform.

Release: 0.5.0
Date: 2004-05-07

The new version 0.5.0 of Infinity gives the user the
capability to resize the window on the fly just with
the mouse. It also include, for the developers,
structured doxygen-like comments on the code, so now
the documentation could be generated automatically
from sources.

Release: 0.4.0 
Date: 2004-05-04
Summary: First release on SourceForge.net

Infinity is a visualization plugin for the XMMS audio
player. It was originally written by Julien Carme,
and is actually maintained by Duilio Protti. This is

rewritten routines for to take advantages of MMX
instructions set. Infinity plugin doesn't require
3D hardware acceleration support.
